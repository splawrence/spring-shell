Throughout this documentation, we make references to configuring something by using
annotations or programmatic examples.

NOTE: There are two annotation models, xref:commands/registration/annotation.adoc[annotations]
referred to new annotation model, xref:commands/registration/legacyannotation.adoc[legacy annotations]
referred to old legacy annotation model.

Old legacy annotation model mostly relates to use of `@ShellMethod` and `@ShellOption` and
new annotation model relates to use of `@Command`.

The programmatic model is how things are actually registered, even if you use annotations.

NOTE: The documentation structure is getting revised to clarify how to provide configurations in separate ways. Thank you for understanding while that work is still in progress.
